## (NEW RELEASE) New version of Zigbee Multi Switch Mc driver as Zigbee Multi Switch and Childs Mc

- Includes preferences to create child devices for each component, including All Switch On-Off.

- You can leave them No option (default option) or create the ones you need with an individual device


## (NEW RELEASE) Version 3.5 update for the Edge Beta Driver: Zigbee Multi Switch Mc

## Improvements:

- Added in preferences a setting to restore the state of the switch after a power loss same as Zigbee Switch Mc:

- Added capability for Device Last Hop Metrics Signal, LQI and RSSI.


## V3 versions of the Zigbee Multi Switch Mc and Zigbee Multi Switch Zemismart Mc

Both drivers have:

- The function of turning on and off all the switches at the same time with a custom capability
- The Mosaic muti component optional and selectable in preferences

The latest updates of the default Beta Edge libraries no longer require the additional code that was in the Zigbee Multi Switch Zemismart Mc driver.

- This code allowed updating the App status of the secondary switches, when On and Off were pressed on the physical switch of the multiple plugs strips.

- I’ve tried my three plug strip and it works the same with one than with another driver.

If anyone detects that this does not work, please tell me

- I have added all the fingerprints of the Zigbee Multi Switch Zemismart Mc driver to the Zigbee Multi Switch Mc driver

## - From now on I will only add new devices to the Zigbee Multi Switch Mc driver

- I will keep the Zigbee Multi Switch Zemismart Mc driver for a reasonable time and when no one misses it I will delete it

- All Zigbee Multi Switch Zemismart Mc driver users will be able to switch to Zigbee Multi Switch Mc driver whenever they want or they can use it as long as they don’t uninstall it from their Hub
